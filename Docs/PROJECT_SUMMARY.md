7. Ecosystem Workflow
	1.	.xlsl = Hub ‚Üí holds general STEM and logic sheets.
	2.	.xqsl = Quantum extension ‚Üí state transfer, entanglement, teleportation.
	3.	.xsim = Simulation ‚Üí runs applied case studies.
	4.	.xrls = Logic ‚Üí validates reasoning and inferences.
	5.	.xai = AI-enhanced ‚Üí keeps reasoning memory and context.
	6.	.xdim = Higher dimensions ‚Üí advanced teleportation and geometry.

Together they form a research language for AI + STEM + reasoning, extendable into practical experiments or simulations.
